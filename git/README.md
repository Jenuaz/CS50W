# GitHub clone

The first step in git is ***git clone*** command. We will create an empty repository in GitHub which is version control (VC) system.
This VC system allow to keep all steps saved while project in developing so developers could collaborate and work simultaniously 
on the same project and the main idea of VC that users can moves around different commits to doungrade their code, return to work 
version of their code or update their code if it was changed on server side and lot of other things.
